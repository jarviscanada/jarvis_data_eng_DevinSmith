# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Greetings, my name is Devin Smith and I am a recent graduate from Memorial University of Newfoundlands Computer Engineering program. I have always been interested in technology, starting with video games as a child. I have since gained interest in 3D modeling, statistical modeling and AI applications. I am a fan of competitive games, and enjoy game theory. My other hobbies include model building, and tabletop games, like Mahjong.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "The Cluster Monitor project measures resource usage by different nodes connected within a Linux Cluster. This was done using Docker to containerize a PostgreSQL instance, and bash scripts which were used to automate data collection into the databases tables using crontab."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: This project is no longer part of the Jarvis training course, but removing this statement breaks the yaml code."
      - "JDBC App: The JBDC app is a java app built with maven and designed to emulate a stock trade wallet with the ability to check stocks and emulate buying and selling them. It connects with an API endpoint using the OKHTTP library, and collects stock quote data. It is parsed using the Jackson databind library and the data is stored in a Postgresql server. It is dockerized for deployment ease, and features a text based user interface."
      - "Grep App: The grep app is designed to emulate the grep command line utility. It was built in java, written through VSCode and then dockerized for easy deployment."
