# Devin Smith . Jarvis Consulting

Greetings, my name is Devin Smith and I am a recent graduate from Memorial University of Newfoundlands Computer Engineering program. I have always been interested in technology, starting with video games as a child. I have since gained interest in 3D modeling, statistical modeling and AI applications.  modeling or AI. I am a fan of competitive games, and enjoy game theory. My other hobbies include model building, and tabletop games, like Mahjong.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DevinSmith/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Cluster Monitor project measures resource usage by different nodes connected within a Linux Cluster. This was done using Docker to containerize a PostgreSQL instance, and bash scripts which were used to automate data collection into the databases tables using crontab.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DevinSmith/tree/master/core_java)]:
